				Printing until the middle of the twentieth century was mainly letterpress, from inked type and photoengravings. The piece of metal which carried the inked letter was <span class="highlight">rectangular</span>. These rectangles increased in height with the size of the letter in ﬁxed increments, so that moveable, reusable type has been described as a modular, standardised system.
			</p>
			<p>
				The printing trade had the habit of ﬁlling out the lines of type with space between the words so that the reader came to expect a textured, rectangular panel of text on the page. The lines were separated horizontally by ﬁxed amounts, packed out with thin strips of lead ~ hence leading. The distance between <span class="highlight">one line and the next </span> appeared as a constant line of white paper. This rectangularity was essential to the mechanical process. (By tightening wedges, the rectangular type and spacing material could be locked in position in a metal frame. This allowed it to be moved from the bench where it was assembled to the bed of a printing press.)
