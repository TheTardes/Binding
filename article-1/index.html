					Printing until the middle of the twentieth century was mainly letterpress, from inked type and photoengravings. The piece of metal which carried the inked letter was rectangular. These rectangles increased in height with the size of the letter in ﬁxed increments, so that moveable, reusable type has been described as a <span class="background-highlight">modular, standardised system.</span>

						The printing trade had the habit of ﬁlling out the lines of type with space between the words so that the reader came to expect a textured, <span class="text-highlight"> rectangular panel</span> of text on the page. The lines were separated horizontally by ﬁxed amounts, packed out with thin strips of lead ~ hence leading. The distance between one line and the next appeared as a constant line of white paper.
					</p>

					<p>
						This rectangularity was essential to the mechanical process. (By tightening wedges, the rectangular type and spacing material could be locked in position in a <span class="text-highlight">metal frame.</span> This allowed it to be moved from the bench where it was assembled to the bed of a printing press.)
					</p>

					<p>
						The essential elements of the grid — rectangularity, standardisation and modules, repetition and separation — are all present in <span class="background-highlight">pre-Modernist</span> typographic design.
					</p>

					<p>
						In twentieth century typographic practice, the grid developed as a means of reducing the number of choices that the designer could make about dimensions of columns and illustrations. Instructions to the printer could be simpler by reference to a <span class="text-highlight">ﬁxed</span> and limited set of measurements.

						<quote>Tell me, are you a Gridnik?</quote> This was the opening question put to me by a distinguished Central European designer. He was inspecting an English art school, and his probing was hostile. The grid was seen as an inhuman weapon used by the young to destroy the graphic whimsy of the old guard.
					</p>

					<p>
						This was in the early 1960s. Serious young typographers had been taken with the Swiss architect Le Corbusier’s Modulor system of <span class="text-highlight">proportions.</span> Students were aware of <span class="background-highlight">Jan Tschichold’s</span> scholarly analyses of page proportions. The Modulor, however, could be applied not only to divisions of the printed sheet, but also to divisions within the print area. This system was one of relationships of size — the determinants of proportion.
					</p>

					<p>
						The concept of <span class="text-highlight">proportion</span> implies aesthetics. In the visual culture of Modernism, aesthetics and function were, ideally, reconciled. The work of stereotype ﬁgures of this culture — of the painter <span class="background-highlight">Mondrian</span> and the <span class="background-highlight">architect Mies</span> - suggests something about the grid.

						Yet, in relation to the grid in print design, the examples of <span class="background-highlight">Mondrian and Mies</span> are deceptive, but at the same time instructive. It is only its rectangularity that connects Mondrian’s work with the <span class="text-highlight">grid:</span> its relationships, the width of its lines and the areas of its planes are arrived at intuitively, by experiment. It provided a formal language: its function was purely aesthetic.

						The concept of proportion implies aesthetics. In the visual culture of Modernism, aesthetics and function were, ideally, reconciled. The work of stereotype ﬁgures of this culture — of the painter Mondrian and the architect Mies - suggests something about the grid. Horizontal and vertical lines divide the painter’s <span class="text-highlight">canvase</span> and the architect’s <span class="text-highlight">façades</span> — deﬁning <span class="background-highlight">Mondrian’s</span> panels of ﬂat colour and Mies’ rectangles of glass or cladding.

					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="background-highlight">Mies' buildings</span> are more relevant to the grid. The design of a modern façade is partly determined by the building’s structure. And in addition to their rectangularity, they use repeated dimensions. But the vertical lines that the architect emphasises for aesthetic reasons are a result of structural demands, of making the building stand up. The word <span class="text-highlight">‘structure’</span> is often applied loosely in discussing two-dimensional design, when it is referring to solely aesthetic judgements. The structure of a sensible <span class="text-highlight">grid</span> is the outcome of the information to be organised within it.

					<p>
						Within the <span class="background-highlight">Modern Movement</span> in Europe in the twentieth century, between the two World Wars, progressive architecture and graphic design were closely related. But the concept of standardisation, of the repetition and combination of standard size elements, was a special concern. In building, as in typography, this was a matter of organising machine-produced parts: in <span class="text-highlight">architecture</span> of joining those parts, and in <span class="text-highlight">printing</span> of ﬁtting them together (individual letters in a word) but more often of separating them (words, lines, columns and pages). In building, there is a structural member or a joint. In print, there is a white space.
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="background-highlight">Mies</span> was the third director of the Bauhaus. His two predecessors, Walter Gropius and Hannes Meyer, were architects with an interest in industrialised building. Yet the school showed no equivalent concern with the inherent mathematics of typography. And <span class="background-highlight">Tschichold</span>, the greatest spokesman and exponent of Modernist typography, in spite of his concern with proportions and type area, seems unaware of <span class="text-highlight">horizontal</span> divisions of the type area and indifferent to the problems of organising text and image — apart from posters.
					</p>

					<p>
						The <span class="background-highlight">Bauhaus founder Gropius</span> later demonstrated the principles of the standardisation necessary for prefabricated construction by illustrating the Japanese system of tatami mats — a grid-like system of modular units with a separating space.

					The typographic <span class="text-highlight">grid</span> come to be associated with Swiss graphic design. Rightly so. In Switzerland, three inﬂuences were at work — inﬂuences speciﬁcally Swiss. First, three of the most active personalities in design were also <span class="text-highlight">‘Concrete’</span> artists, whose work was not only abstract, but had a mathematical and programmatic basis — features it shared with typography. These artist-designers were Max Bill, <span class="background-highlight">Richard Paul Lohse</span> and <span class="background-highlight">Karl Gerstner.</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Second, in the <span class="background-highlight">Swiss Werkbund,</span> architects were by far the largest professional group. The magazine, Das Werk, was the journal not only of the Werkbund, but of the <span class="background-highlight">Swiss Architects Association.</span> This contributed to a shared outlook. And Swiss architects had been pressing since the 1920s for the rationalisation and standardisation of the trade catalogues of building components and ﬁttings which formed part of their everyday working lives.
				</p>

				<p>
					The third factor was the use of <span class="text-highlight">three-column</span> text pages, to deal with both Swiss three-language publications (German, French and Italian) and for the documents produced by international organisations with homes in Switzerland (Red Cross, United Nations).

						The <span class="text-highlight">grid</span> was a concept that emerged only gradually. It seems almost eccentric that <span class="background-highlight">Bill, the chief pioneer of the typographical grid,</span> did not realise its value earlier. Bill, as well as being an experienced graphic designer, was an architect and an admirer of <span class="background-highlight">Le Corbusier,</span> who had been working on his Modulor from 1942 until its publication in 1948.
					</p>

					<p>
						Bill designed several volumes recording <span class="background-highlight">Le Corbusier’s</span> work. With the ﬁrst, published in 1939 in a horizontal <span class="text-highlight">three-column</span> format, he made no attempt to standardise the sizes of illustration. In the next volume, published in 1946, while there is some consistency in the height of horizontal photographs at the bottom of the page, there is no systematic control.

					<p> Yet in <span class="background-highlight">The New Architecture,</span> a book Bill had designed in 1940, the photographs are restricted to the depths and widths prescribed by the grid of <span class="text-highlight">3x3</span> rectangles. When Bill came to design his own book on the bridge builder Robert Maillart, he reused some of the photoengraved blocks from The New Architecture. With a squarer format and a grid of two columns plus a half column, Bill provided himself with an astonishingly <span class="background-highlight">ﬂexible system </span>that allowed him to organise photographs in several sizes and proportions with technical drawings, text and captions.
					</p>


					<p>
						The author of The New Architecture was <span class="background-highlight">Alfred Roth, editor of Werk.</span> In 1955, a young artist-designer working at the Swiss pharmaceutical concern Geigy suggested to Roth that the magazine might publish more on graphic design. The designer was Gerstner, and the result was a special issue that appeared in November 1955. <span class="background-highlight">Gerstner</span> reproduced nearly 150 posters, brochures, trademarks, stationery, advertisements and packaging. It is only when reconstructing the grid, which Gerstner used to cope with the varying <span class="text-highlight">proportions</span> of the work reproduced, that its complexity and ﬂexibility can be understood.

					</p>


					<p>
						A basic grid can give <span class="text-highlight">coherence</span> to headlines, text and pictures; it can allow a number of designers to work on the same publication with some freedom, yet with constraints that prevent it from losing its overall graphic identity. Some years after the Werk issue, Gerstner produced a famously elaborate grid for the <span class="background-highlight">German business magazine CapitaI.</span> But Gerstner’s most elaborate use of the grid was for the novel Schiff nach Europa (Boat to Europe) in 1959. This demonstrates the origin of the typographical grid in the rectangular modular system of metal type.
