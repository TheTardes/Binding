## Overview

Equilibrium is a  website designed to present the balance between structure, simplicity, and chaos in design. Three articles have been used to form the concept: 
* Modernist Grid (exploring the order and structure of grids in design)
* Towards a Complex Simplicity (discussing the balance between simplicity and complexity)
* Cult of the Ugly (challenging traditional design aesthetics with chaos and imperfection).

The website reflects the idea that design is not about choosing one approach but finding harmony between these opposing forces.

## Features

* Responsive design for viewing across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
* Accessible navigation for an intuitive user experience.
* Visual and typographic styles that reflect the balance of structure, simplicity, and chaos - my concept.


## Concept and Inspiration

The concept of Equilibrium was inspired by the idea that design is a balance of diverse forces:
* Structure is order and stability (Modernist Grid).
* Simplicity is clarity and focus (Towards a Complex Simplicity).
* Chaos is energy and creativity (Cult of the Ugly).

I chose this concept to explore how these elements coexist and influence each other in design, and push us beyond traditional boundaries to create functional, effective but also meaningful products. Overall, the project represents my interpretation of design as a balance of many things. I want to send a message that, no single "guide" is a guide for the "best design".
