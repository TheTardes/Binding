					Beauty and ugliness are subjective concepts that vary across cultures, disciplines, and individual perspectives. From Voltaire's musings on a toad's perception of beauty to <span class="background-highlight">Paul Rand's</span> philosophy on design, the evolution of aesthetics challenges traditional norms and embraces experimentation. <span class="background-highlight">The Cranbrook Academy of Art's </span>Output publication exemplifies this shift, provoking debates on the role of ugliness in graphic design. This article explores the tensions between traditional and experimental aesthetics, the rise of the <span class="background-highlight">"cult of ugliness,"</span> and the implications for the future of design.

						"Ask a toad what is beauty… He will answer that it is a female with two great round eyes coming out of her little head, a large flat mouth, a yellow belly and a brown back." (Voltaire, Philosophical Dictionary, 1794). Ask <span class="background-highlight">Paul Rand</span> what is beauty and he will answer that "the separation of form and function, of concept and execution, is not likely to produce objects of <span class="text-highlight">aesthetic</span> value". (Paul Rand: A Designer's Art, 1985).

					</p>

					<p>
						Then ask the same question of the <span class="background-highlight">Cranbrook Academy of Art</span> students who created the ad hoc desktop publication Output (1992), and to judge by the evidence they might answer that beauty is chaos born of found letters layered on top of <span class="text-highlight">random</span> patterns and shapes. Those who value functional simplicity would argue that the <span class="background-highlight">Cranbrook</span> students' publication, like a toad's warts, is ugly. The difference is that unlike the toad, the <span class="background-highlight">Cranbrook</span> students have deliberately given themselves the warts.

						Output is eight unbound pages of blips, type fragments, <span class="text-highlight">random words</span> and other graphic minutiae purposefully given the serendipitous look of a printer's make-ready. The lack of any explanatory précis (and only this end note: Upcoming Issues From: <span class="background-highlight">School of the Art Institute of Chicago [and] University of Texas</span>) leaves the reader confused as to its purpose or meaning, though its form leads one to presume that it is intended as a design manifesto, another <span class="text-highlight">experiment</span> in the current plethora of aesthetically questionable graphic output. Given the increase in graduate school programmes which provide both a laboratory setting and freedom from professional responsibility, the word experiment has come to justify a multitude of sins.

						The value of design experiments should not of course be measured only by what succeeds, since failures are often steps towards new discoveries. <span class="text-highlight">Experimentation</span> is the engine of progress, its fuel a mixture of instinct, intelligence and discipline. But the engine floods when too much instinct and not enough intelligence or discipline is injected into the mix. This is the case with certain of the graphic design <span class="text-highlight">experiments</span> that have emanated from graduate schools in the US and Europe in recent years – work driven by instinct and obscured by theory, with <span class="text-highlight">ugliness</span> its foremost by-product.
					</p>

					<p>
						How is <span class="text-highlight">ugly</span> to be defined in the current postmodern design climate where existing systems are up for re-evaluation, order is under attack and the forced collision of disparate forms is the rule? For the moment, let us say that ugly decision, as opposed to classical design (where adherence to the golden mean and a preference for <span class="background-highlight">balance and harmony serve as the foundation</span> for even the most unconventional compositions) is the layering of unharmonious graphic forms in a way that results in confusing messages.

						By this definition, Output could be considered a prime example of <span class="text-highlight">ugliness</span> in the service of fashionable experimentation. Though not intended to function in the commercial world, it was distributed to thousands of practising designers on the <span class="background-highlight">American Institute of Graphic Arts</span> and <span class="background-highlight">American Center for Design </span>mailing lists, so rather than remain cloistered and protected from criticism as on-campus "research", it is a fair subject for scrutiny. It can legitimately be described as representing the current cult of <span class="text-highlight">ugliness</span>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The layered images, vernacular hybrids, low-resolution reproductions and cacophonous blends of different types and letters at once challenge prevailing aesthetic beliefs and propose alternative paradigms. Like the output of communications rebels of the past (whether <span class="background-highlight">1920s Futurists or 1960s psychedelic</span> artists), this work demands that the viewer or reader accept non-traditional formats which at best guide the eye for a specific purpose through a range of <span class="text-highlight">non-linear</span> "pathways", and at worst result in confusion.

					</p>

					<p>
						But the reasons behind this wave are dubious. <span class="background-highlight">Does the current social and cultural condition involve the kind of upheaval to which critical ugliness is a time-honoured companion? </span>Or in the wake of earlier, more serious experimentation, has ugliness simply been assimilated into popular culture and become a stylish conceit?

						The current wave began in the mid-1970s with the English <spa class="text-highlight">punk scene,</spa> a raw expression of youth frustration manifested through shocking dress, music and art. Punk's naïve graphic language – an aggressive rejection of rational typography that echoes <span class="background-highlight">Dada and Futurist work</span> – influenced designers during the late 1970s who seriously tested the limits imposed by <span class="background-highlight">Modernist formalism.</span>


					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="text-highlight">Punk's</span> violent demeanour surfaced in <span class="background-highlight">Swiss, American, Dutch and French</span> design and spread to the mainstream in the form of a "new wave", or what American punk artist<span class="background-highlight"> Gary Panter</span> has called "sanitised punk". A key anti-canonical approach later called Swiss Punk – which in comparison with the gridlocked <span class="background-highlight">Swiss International Style</span> was menacingly chaotic, though rooted in its own logic – was born in the mecca of rationalism, Basel during the late 1970s. For the elders who were threatened (and offended) by the onslaught to criticise Swiss Punk as <span class="text-highlight">ugly</span> was avoiding the issue. Swiss Punk was attacked not so much because of its appearance as because it symbolised the demise of <span class="background-highlight">modernist hegemony.</span>

						<span class="text-highlight">Ugly</span> design can be a conscious attempt to create and define alternative standards. Like warpaint, the dissonant styles applied by contemporary designers are meant to shock complacency and encourage new viewing patterns. <span class="background-highlight">American designer Art Chantry</span> combines this shock-and-educate approach with appropriateness, creating low-budget graphics for the Seattle <span class="text-highlight">punk</span> scene by using found artefacts from industrial catalogues. While horrifying to those favoring Shaker functionalism, <span class="background-highlight">Chantry's</span> work is functional within its context, proving that <span class="text-highlight">ugly</span> forms can result in good design.

					<p>
						<span class="background-highlight">Postmodernism</span> inspired a debate in the mid-1970s, questioning the certainties of <span class="background-highlight">Modernism</span> and rebelling against Eurocentric narratives. Graphic design stripped Modernist formality of its infrastructure, replacing the grid with dots, blips, and arrows. However, this <span class="text-highlight">rebellion</span> often reduced itself to mannerisms, where extremism gave rise to fashionable <span class="text-highlight">ugliness</span> as nihilistic expression.
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="background-highlight">Keats</span> wrote,<quote> “Beauty is truth, truth beauty,”</quote> but today, neither beauty nor ugliness represents universal truth. Convention-busting design from schools like <span class="background-highlight">Cranbrook and CalArts </span>may shape new standards, though it often uses theoretical constructs to justify what seems <span class="text-highlight">ugly</span> to the untutored eye.


					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="background-highlight">John Cage</span> noted,<quote> “Where [beauty] ends is where the artist begins,” </quote>necessitating the suspension of popular notions of beauty to explore alternative aesthetics. Segura's <span class="text-highlight">chaotic</span> booklet for the 1993 How magazine conference illustrates this, combining ingenuity with superficiality, resulting in a catalogue of <span class="text-highlight">disharmony</span>.

				<p>
					Designers like <span class="background-highlight">Edward Fella</span> embraced vernacular traditions, introducing excesses like fat typefaces and dingbats, anathema to early Modernists. While <span class="background-highlight">Fella's</span> work critiques corporate slickness, its aggressive unconventionality often veers into ugliness. <span class="background-highlight">Lorraine Wild</span> defends such <span class="text-highlight">experimentation</span>as appropriate for graduate programs, but unchecked freedoms can lead to ambiguity and misguidance among students.
				</p>

				<p>
					The excesses of graduate school design—like Output—are often pushed into the real world, furthering ambiguity and self-indulgence. Critic Dugald Stermer aptly calls this <quote>“adults making kids' drawings.”</quote> Art Chantry transforms naïve elements into tools, but <span class="background-highlight">Jeffery Keedy's</span> typeface Lushus, used unironically, exemplifies how extremism perpetuates bad design. <span class="text-highlight">Ugliness</span>, when purposeful, can be refreshing, but as its own virtue, it diminishes design.

						<quote>"Rarely has beauty been an end in itself,"</quote> wrote <span class="background-highlight">Paul Rand</span> in Paul Rand: A Designer's Art. And it is equally mistaken to treat ugliness as an end in itself. <span class="text-highlight">Ugliness</span> is valid, even refreshing, when it is key to an indigenous language representing alternative ideas and cultures.
					</p>
					<p>
						The problem with the cult of ugly graphic design emanating from the major design academies and their alumni is that it has so quickly become a style that appeals to anyone without the intelligence, discipline or good sense to make something more interesting out of it.
					</p>

					<p>
						While the proponents are following their various muses, their followers are misusing their signature designs and typography as style without substance. <span class="text-highlight">Ugliness</span> as a tool, a weapon, even as a code is not a problem when it is a result of form following function. But <span class="text-highlight">ugliness</span> as its own virtue – or as a knee-jerk reaction to the status quo – diminishes all design.
